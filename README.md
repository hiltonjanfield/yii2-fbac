Flag Based Access Control for Yii 2

This extension provides Flag-Based Access Control (and more) for Yii Framework 2.0+.
FBAC is an alternative to RBAC which uses human readable strings to provide access control to single functions or
entire areas as desired. No initial or extra setup is required to create a "flag" - just start using it.
